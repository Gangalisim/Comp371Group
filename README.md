COMP 371
For our group project and presentation we have chosen to model a
procedurally generated world. In our case this will be a forest. We plan to
feature a variety of plant life, potentially being trees, bushes, and maybe even
grass, that will be created algorithmically. In addition to these procedurally
generated items, we will also feature assets that will not be repeated, like a
bridge or tunnel, and as such will not be procedurally generated. The user of
our program may be able to enter some parameters that controls how the
world would be generated. Once generated, the world can be traversed by the
user in a first person view that will restrict the user from passing through any
of the assets.
In order to do this, we will split the objectives in a way that integration can
be managed easily. We will have a single group member create the base of the
world and accomodation of user inputs. This will allow another member to
focus on the generation of the repeated assets. Another member will be in
charge of the import and integration of the nonrepeated assets. The nal
group member will be in charge of the user traversal and collision.
This roadmap is tentative, as our world that we wish to create may change
over time. If we feel that a certain part of the workload is too heavy or too
light, or if the vision of the individual does not align with that of the groups,
we will redistribute accordingly. //
